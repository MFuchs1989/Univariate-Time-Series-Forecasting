Most of the time we deal with cross-sectional data. Here, the data is collected at a specific point in time. On the other hand, time series data is a collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time.

## Introduction

In this repository I have deposited a Jupyter notebook which contains various neruonal networks for time series predictions. 
With this script you can quickly and easily check which type of neural network fits best to the data.

## Software Requirements

Required libraries:

+ Python 3.x
+ Numpy
+ Pandas
+ Matplotlib
+ Scikit-Learn
+ Tensorflow


Please run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Besides the Jupyter notebook and the dataframe I created a model file.
The created models are automatically saved in this directory when the script is executed.



<a name="getting_started"></a>

## Getting Started

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the respective project's root directory in the terminal
3. Use a command line of your choice and navigate to the respective project's root directory. Run the following commands:
    1. ```cd "path/to/root directory"```
    2. ```jupyter notebook"```
4. In the browser window that opens, select the Jupyter Notebook file.
5. Select the parameters of the neural network as desired.
6. Select *Cell* in the menu shown above and execute *Run All*.

## Overview of the Results

I used five different Neural Networks:

+ LSTM
+ Bidirectional LSTM
+ GRU
+ Encoder Decoder LSTM
+ CNN

I trained each of them in two different ways:

+ Single Step Style
+ Horizon Style

Here is an overview of the results:

![overview_results](images/overview_results.png)

The Long short-term memory model with a RMSE (root-mean-square error) of 533 is almost 60% better than the CNN model which is the worst of all.

## Link to the Publication

Here is the link to my blog post: [Time Series Analysis - Neural Networks for Forecasting Univariate Variables](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/11/01/time-series-analysis-neural-networks-for-forecasting-univariate-variables/). In it I explained the exact difference of the methods used and described my procedure in detail.
